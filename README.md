# Test Task Assessment

This repo is created as a part of test task assessment.  
I've just initialized the repo to submit a link. The task is not ready yet.

I was told that I am to complete the task in 2-5 hours, up to 7 hours.  
At the same time, I wasn't informed that I need to record a video, and that videos longer than 60 seconds cannot be downloaded.  
It took me about 2 hours, before I even could see the test task.

At the moment of this submission, it is about 3 hours after I initialized the repo. At that moment, I've implemented basic layout and the form.
I don't have enough experience with Next.js, so I doubt I'll finish it today.

**If you are reading this, it means the task is still incomplete.**
